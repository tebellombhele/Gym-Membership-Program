# Gym-Membership-Program
This is a basic Java membership management program for a fitness center.
This fitness centre has three outlets: Club Bronze, Club Silver and Club Gold. 
It also has two types of members:
Single Club Members and Multi Club Members.
A single club member has access to only one of the three clubs. 
A multi club member, on the other hand, has access to all three clubs.
The membership fee of a member depends on whether he/she is a single club or a multi club member. For single club members, the fees also depend on which club he/she has access to.
Finally, multi club members are awarded membership points for joining the club. 
Upon sign up, they are awarded 100 points which they can use to redeem gifts and drinks from the store. 
The program will not handle the redemption process (Yet).
All that we’ll do is add 100 points to the multi clubmember’s account.
This application uses a csv file to store information about each member.
Whenever you launch the application, you’ll read the information from the csv file and transfer it to a LinkedList. When you add a member to the LinkedListor remove a member from it, you’ll update the csv file.
Note: Some additional features will be added in future...
